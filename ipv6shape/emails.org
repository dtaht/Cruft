Now, let's say that the link between the west most switch and the west coast PC is only 10 Mbit/s, while all others are 100 Mbit/s.
Let's also say each switch has a 512 kB FIFO buffer. And that the PCs are using an OS with TCP window scaling.

Q: How much buffer is being used in each switch?
A: From East to West: none, none, all of 512 kB.

Q: How much latency does this add?
A: About 400 ms.
