** Redmine 1.1?
*** Need to migrate anyway to pg
- first, install redmine in a fresh postgre database
- then copy the rows from every table from the mysql database to the postgresql, truncating the postgresql tables first.
- select max(id) from MyTable; => max(id) + 1 (MaxIdPlusOne) => use that number in an ALTER SEQUENCE MyTable_id_seq RESTART with MaxIdPlusOne; That for every table with a sequence.

Re:
http://icir.org/floyd/ecn.html

MAC OS X:
Leopard 10.5.0 implements ECN, controlled by the variables "net.inet.tcp.ecn_negotiate_in" and "net.inet.tcp.ecn_initiate_out". Reported by Rui Paulo, 2007. 

*** For tunnels

   ECN friendly behavior
     gif can be configured to be ECN friendly, as described in draft-ietf-ipsec-ecn-02.txt.  This is turned
     off by default, and can be turned on by IFF_LINK1 interface flag.

     Without IFF_LINK1, gif will show a normal behavior, like described in RFC2893.  This can be summarized
     as follows:

           Ingress  Set outer TOS bit to 0.

           Egress   Drop outer TOS bit.

     With IFF_LINK1, gif will copy ECN bits (0x02 and 0x01 on IPv4 TOS byte or IPv6 traffic class byte) on
     egress and ingress, as follows:

           Ingress  Copy TOS bits except for ECN CE (masked with 0xfe) from inner to outer.  Set ECN CE bit
                    to 0.

           Egress   Use inner TOS bits with some change.  If outer ECN CE bit is 1, enable ECN CE bit on the
                    inner.

     Note that the ECN friendly behavior violates RFC2893.  This should be used in mutual agreement with the
     peer.
